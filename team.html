            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>This epic tale began when Gatito found a <a href="https://x.com/AnotherFurryCon/status/1791572248329142566">post</a> on Twitter by one of his favorite celebrities. After doing some thinking, he decided that since this was to be taking place after his birthday, it would be really cool if he could go. So, he made some arrangements and is all set to go!</p>
            <p>However, Gatito also decided it would be cool to invite his online friends along. And so, they will set off on what is possibly the most legendary adventure in the history of both group chats.</p>
